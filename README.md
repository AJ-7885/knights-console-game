# knights-console-game

### Simple console app

6 Knights stand in a circle
Each knight has 100 health points
Every knight hits his neighbor in a clockwise way (damage is random between 1-6 like rolling a dice)
When a knight has <= 0 health, he is out of the game
Example: If knight 1 kills knight 2, knight 1 will hit knight 3 in the next round
Repeat until only one knight is left

### Outputs:
```
Knight x hits Knight y for n damage
Knight x dies
Knight x wins
````
